<p>Pitches for Dataviz Project</p>

<p>1) Last month, the Chronicle published this article entitled Bay Area House members frequently miss votes. Almost every claim made in that article is quantifiable, verifiable, and would likely be better as a chart. It also makes no sense arbitrarily choosing the Bay Area and not comparing to other states, averages, and conditions. I want to look at the entire house and see who has missed how many votes this year, what the averages are per state over a certain period, how they compare to the national average, and report out some of the reasons of missing votes. There would be several different charts for this, one displaying the various state averages, one showing committee chairs, one looking at distance and seeing if that plays a factor in missing votes, another would look at when big votes happened and whether those drew significant attendance compared to the averages. This can be explained a little more.</p>

<p>2) A comprehensive analysis of ‘‘the next Detroit” syndrome in California. I’d look at maybe the top 10-15 population cities in California and the state itself and look at the pension obligations compared to revenues and have several line charts comparing those cities, assessing what many fear is a big problem for cities in America. Some of the criteria is laid out here, but I think focusing on pension/retirement liabilities would be the way to go, since that seems to be the factor many have harped on. I’d also like to see how dependent each of these cities are on any one industry, or if they are more diversified. And of course I would look at deficits and surpluses. And maybe even population sizes. The challenge for this one would be data-gathering.</p>

<p>3) Campaign spending in the wake of Citizens United. As the Supreme Court gears up to take on the next campaign spending case, I’d like to analyze and visualize how donating money in politics has changed over the last several years. This could be a bar chart (or a serious of bar charts) that have a time x-axis (or even a line chart) that display money oscillating over the years. I would break it out into different types of money (soft money, hard money, money donated to 527s, etc.) and show turning points in recent campaign spending history (McCain--Feingold, Citizens United, etc.). This NY Times article gives a good grounding on the type of reporting I would do.</p>
