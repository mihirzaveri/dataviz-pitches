<h1>Revised Pitch for 10/22</h1>

<p>Congressmen frequently miss votes, sometimes important ones. What would cause America’s rulemakers to abandon their seats? One assertion is that for many legislators, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtontimes.com%2Fnews%2F2013%2Ffeb%2F19%2Fawol-on-hillfundraisingtrumps-voting-records-show-%2F%3Fpage%3Dall&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNH9Fy2DLU_xhj9cE42OLTr01XtkLA">fundraising</a> and <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2012/07/10/republican-congressman-wants-to-dock-pay-for-members-who-miss-votes/">campaigning</a> often trump casting votes. Here is an article done for <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Bay-Area-House-members-frequently-miss-votes-4803481.php">bay area legislators</a>.

I want to take a look at swing districts around the country (districts in which legislators won by a narrow margin), where candidates often <a href="http://politicsinminnesota.com/2012/10/spending-groundwork-ramp-up-in-key-legislative-swing-districts/">campaign the hardest</a> to hold on to their seats. I will look at these swing districts and see whether there is any correlation between representing a swing district and missing house votes. This might suggest that more competitive elections might also involve less attention to actual legislation. If there isn’t a correlation, it might help dispel the notion that campaigning keeps congressmen from voting and that other reasons might be the factor. 

Campaigns are already heating up for the 2014 election, and this sort of insight into voting behavior would be valuable for those going to the polls. 

There are a number of political scientists -- some here at UC Berkeley -- who could provide some context and insight to the findings. There are probably a million lurking variables which I would need to address. The candidates and their campaign teams could also talk about how difficult it is to campaign and legislate at the same time. 

I could see something like this being published with the Center for Public Integrity or the Washington Post.

Questions for my data:

- How many votes have each of the legislators’ missed since they took their seats? What is the average number? Average percent historically? Are there outliers? What are the explanations for those outliers? Who missed the most votes and who missed the least? How do these questions look when broken down by state?
- Which one of these legislators are in swing districts (where the last election was decided by less than or equal to five percentage points)? What do the numbers look like for these districts? How do these numbers compare to the overall numbers?</p>

<h1>Original Pitch</h1>

<p>1) Last month, the Chronicle published this article entitled Bay Area House members frequently miss votes. Almost every claim made in that article is quantifiable, verifiable, and would likely be better as a chart. It also makes no sense arbitrarily choosing the Bay Area and not comparing to other states, averages, and conditions. I want to look at the entire house and see who has missed how many votes this year, what the averages are per state over a certain period, how they compare to the national average, and report out some of the reasons of missing votes. There would be several different charts for this, one displaying the various state averages, one showing committee chairs, one looking at distance and seeing if that plays a factor in missing votes, another would look at when big votes happened and whether those drew significant attendance compared to the averages. This can be explained a little more.</p>
